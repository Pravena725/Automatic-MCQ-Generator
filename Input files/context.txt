'When water is added to the flour, the proteins come together and form a new protein called gluten.'
'They coat the proteins in the flour, which prevents them from mixing with water and forming gluten.'
'As the cake bakes, the gas bubbles get trapped in the batter, which makes the cake light and fluffy.'
'When it’s heated, the protein in the egg opens up and helps bind by making the batter into a semi-solid state.'
